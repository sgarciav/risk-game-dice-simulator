# About

Welcome! We all ove playing RISK, but we hate waiting for others to roll their
die to fight their battles. We also hate having to keep track of how many troops
each team has left after each roll. So why not simulate the process? That's
exactly what we did. Take advantage of our exciting interface to simulate your
RISK dice rolls and focus on taking over the world!
