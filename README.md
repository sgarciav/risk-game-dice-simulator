# About

Welcome! We all ove playing RISK, but we hate waiting for others to roll their
die to fight their battles. We also hate having to keep track of how many troops
each team has left after each roll. So why not simulate the process? That's
exactly what we did. Take advantage of our exciting interface to simulate your
RISK dice rolls and focus on taking over the world!

# Usage

* For help on the inputs and options, open a new terminal and execute:

        $ cd path/to/scripts
        $ ./rolldie.py -h

* Each iteration of the simulation represents one battle. The program will ask
  user if they want to continue or stop. Progress is displayed after each battle.
